# Credibility Checklist for Health and Scientific Information

A general-purpose checklist for evaluating the reliability and neutrality of health-related information, medical studies, and scientific recommendations. This is intended for use in research, writing, development, and decision-making.

---

## Source Transparency

- [ ] Is the author or publishing organization clearly identified?
- [ ] Are the authorâ€™s credentials or expertise relevant to the topic?
- [ ] Is the funding source or sponsor clearly disclosed?
- [ ] Is the publication medium traceable and accessible (e.g., journal, report, site)?

---

## Independence and Vested Interests

- [ ] Is there evidence that the content was created **independent of commercial pressure**?
- [ ] Is the study or article **free from corporate or institutional influence** that could bias results?
- [ ] If funding is provided, is the **source financially neutral** to the outcome?
- [ ] Does the research team or institution have a **history of balanced, critical reporting**?
- [ ] Are all potential conflicts of interest (financial and non-financial) of the authors/organization clearly disclosed?

---

## Evidence and Referencing

- [ ] Are references included to peer-reviewed journals, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses?
- [ ] Is the cited evidence traceable and relevant to the claims?
- [ ] Does the content distinguish between expert opinion and published data?

---

## Peer Review and Scientific Rigor

- [ ] Was the study or source peer-reviewed?
- [ ] Is the publication reputable (e.g., PubMed-indexed, impact factor, open-access archives)?
- [ ] If preprint or non-peer-reviewed, is the data available and clearly explained?
- [ ] Are conflicts of interest properly disclosed by the authors?

---

## Replication and Scientific Context

- [ ] Have similar findings been replicated by independent researchers?
- [ ] Is the content consistent with current expert consensus?
- [ ] If divergent, is high-quality evidence provided to support the exception?

---

## Methodological Validity

- [ ] Is the study design appropriate for the question (e.g., RCT, longitudinal, meta-analysis)?
- [ ] Is the sample size sufficient to support conclusions?
- [ ] Are the statistical methods appropriate and transparently described?

---
## Data and Code Transparency

- [ ] Are raw data and analysis code publicly available or accessible?
- [ ] Is there clear documentation or metadata supporting reproducibility?
---
- [ ] Does the study discuss the practical or clinical significance of its findings, not just statistical significance?

---

## Clarity and Caution

- [ ] Are claims presented in measured, precise language?
- [ ] Are limitations clearly stated?
- [ ] Does the content avoid overstatement, absolute claims, or clickbait headlines?

---

## Practical Applicability

- [ ] Is the recommendation or result applicable in real-world settings?
- [ ] Are side effects, trade-offs, or population differences acknowledged?
- [ ] Is it clear when the results do *not* generalize?

---

## Timeliness and Relevance

- [ ] Is the information recent, or has it been superseded?
- [ ] If older, is it still supported by recent studies or reviews?

---

## Intent and Language

- [ ] Is the tone objective, scientific, and educational?
- [ ] Is the goal to inform (not persuade or sell)?
- [ ] Are all claims **verifiable, reproducible, and non-anecdotal**?
