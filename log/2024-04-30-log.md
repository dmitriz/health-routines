✅ routine-plan.md – Full Version (v0.2 Complete)

# Daily Health + Focus System (v0.2)

This document defines a minimal, resilient system to maintain physical and cognitive focus during work—especially during deep tasks like writing, coding, or planning. It evolves gradually based on real use, not theory.

---

## ✅ Current Reminders (Cycled)

These reminders rotate every 30 minutes using a terminal-based script with a subtle terminal bell (`tput bel`) and clear printed message.

1. 🧠 **Look far away** – *20-20-20 rule*
   - Every 30 minutes, look at something ≥20 feet away for ≥20 seconds
   - Bonus: alternate near/far focus to exercise visual accommodation

2. 🦵 **Leg lifts** – *seated or standing*
   - Lift each leg slowly while seated or standing
   - Replaces squats (which were removed due to back tension)

3. 🧘 **Neck stretch or tilt**
   - Gentle side tilt or rotation
   - Optionally roll shoulders if stiff

⏱ These cycle **in order**, not randomly, to reduce unpredictability and mental friction.

## 🛠️ Active Script

### `health_reminder_cycle.sh` *(v0.2)*

**Behavior:**
- Runs forever in a terminal or via `pm2`
- Sleeps 1800 seconds (30 min)
- Triggers `tput bel` (bell sound)
- Prints the next reminder in cycle

**Execution (minimal version):**

```bash
bash -c '
suggestions=(
  "🧠  Look far away for 20 seconds (20-20-20)"
  "🦵  Leg lifts – seated or standing"
  "🧘  Neck stretch or head tilt"
);
index=0
echo -e "\n✅ Health reminder script started (cycled mode). First tip in 30 minutes.\n"
while true; do
  sleep 1800
  tput bel
  echo -e "\n==================== HEALTH REMINDER ====================\n"
  echo -e "${suggestions[$index]}\n"
  echo -e "=========================================================\n"
  index=$(( (index + 1) % ${#suggestions[@]} ))
done
'

Status:

✅ Working on desktop Linux

❌ Not yet ported to mobile or with desktop notifications

⏳ Future: optional louder alerts or visual notification



---

❌ Removed from v0.1

Squats: removed due to discomfort; replaced with gentler leg movements

Random selection: replaced with cycling for clarity and rhythm



---

🧠 Guiding Principles

Minimum mental effort: no decisions during breaks

Low setup friction: no downloads, no GUIs, copy-paste and run

Listen to feedback: discomfort = discard and adapt

Keep it modular: routines evolve one step at a time



---

🔄 Routines to Revisit Later

These are low-priority or experimental:

✅ Eye relaxation: alternate focus near/far

⏳ Arm swings

⏳ Breathing resets

❓ Simple hand or wrist stretches
