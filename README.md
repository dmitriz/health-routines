# Health Routines & Resilience

[![Git Hooks](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-hooks-brightgreen.svg)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)

This repository is an evolving system for managing health routines and habits.

## Git Hooks

This repository uses Git hooks to ensure code quality and prevent common mistakes. The following hooks are configured:

### Pre-commit Hook
- **Location**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- **Functionality**:
  - Automatically creates/updates `.gitignore` with required patterns
  - Runs tests if `package.json` has a test script
  - Prevents commits without proper configuration
- **Implementation**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **To disable**: `chmod -x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

### Update Hook
- **Location**: `.git/hooks/update`
- **Functionality**:
  - Prevents direct pushes to protected branches (main/master)
  - Requires pull requests for changes to protected branches
  - Verifies merge status before allowing updates
- **Implementation**: JavaScript (Node.js)

### Required .gitignore Patterns

The following patterns are enforced in `.gitignore`:

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
package-lock.json
yarn.lock

# Environment
.env
.env.*
!.env.example

# Build output
dist/
build/

# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Editor directories and files
.idea
.vscode
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj
*.sln
*.sw?

# System Files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

### Git Hook Rules

1. **Branch Protection**:
   - Direct pushes to `main` and `master` are blocked
   - All changes must go through feature branches
   - Pull requests are required for protected branches

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Tests must pass before commit
   - `.gitignore` must be properly configured
   - No unnecessary files are committed

3. **Workflow**:
   - Create feature branches for new work
   - Submit pull requests for review
   - Never commit directly to protected branches

### Usage

1. **Committing Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Changes will be checked by pre-commit hook
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

2. **Pushing Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Push to feature branch
   git push origin feature/your-branch
   ```

3. **Disabling Hooks**:
   ```bash
   # Temporarily disable pre-commit hook
   chmod -x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

## Project Purpose

This repository is an evolving system for

- Maintaining deep focus during cognitively demanding work
- Reducing mental fatigue through body-aware habits
- Building sustainable, low-friction daily routines

It evolves incrementally, based on actual use and experience.

## Git Hooks

This repository includes Git hooks to maintain code quality:

### Pre-commit Hook
- **Location**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- **Purpose**: Runs tests before allowing a commit
- **To disable**: `chmod -x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
- **To enable**: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

### Pre-push Hook
- **Location**: `.git/hooks/pre-push`
- **Purpose**: Runs tests before allowing a push
- **To disable**: `chmod -x .git/hooks/pre-push`
- **To enable**: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push`

### Verifying Hooks
To verify the hooks are working:

1. Make a small change to a test file
2. Try to commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test commit"
   ```
3. The pre-commit hook should run tests automatically if a test script is defined in package.json
4. If tests pass, commit succeeds. If they fail, commit is blocked

## âœ… Core Components

### 1. `/log/` â€“ Reflections, Notes, Daily Progress
Use this folder to track:
- Daily logs (`YYYY-MM-DD-log.md`)
- Thinking snapshots
- Decisions or events worth remembering

âž¡ <a href="https://github.com/dmitriz/health-routines/new/main/log?filename=YYYY-MM-DD-log.md" onclick="this.href=this.href.replace('YYYY-MM-DD', new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10))">Create new log</a> (auto-dated)

---

### 2. ðŸ“¥ Inbox (GitHub Issues)
Capture ideas, tasks, or notes quickly via issues.

âž¡ [Open new inbox item](https://github.com/dmitriz/health-routines/issues/new)

You can later triage, promote to files, or group related issues.

---

### 3. **Routine Plan**
Live routine logic and scripts: reminders, eye care, movement, break cycles.

- [Routine Plan (Issue)](https://github.com/dmitriz/health-routines/issues/5)
- [Planned script path](scripts/health_reminder_cycle.sh) *(coming soon)*

Includes:
- Current movement reminders
- Bash script logic
- Version notes (v0.2)
- Next step ideas

---

## ðŸ”œ Scripts & Automation (Planned)

Scripts in development include:
- ðŸ”œ `health_reminder_cycle.sh` â€“ terminal reminder script
- ðŸ”œ GitHub Action to auto-create daily log
- ðŸ”œ Log summarizer or triage script

---

## ðŸ§  Principles

- Low friction: no setup, no bloat
- Modular: routines grow piece by piece
- Honest: discard what doesn't work
- Lightweight: text-based, portable, easy to maintain

---

## ðŸ”„ Getting Started

You can begin by:
- Opening an [inbox issue](https://github.com/dmitriz/health-routines/issues/new)
- Creating a [daily log](https://github.com/dmitriz/health-routines/new/main/log?filename=<YYYY-MM-DD>-log.md) (manually update date in filename)
- Running the health reminder script (coming soon)

No formal structure needed. This is your system.
