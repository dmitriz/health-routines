# My health routines

lightweight logs, reflections, notes, and snapshots of evolving systems and routines.

## Purpose

- Track progress over time
- Document decisions and reasoning
- Keep notes outside of noisy channels (email, chat, etc.)
- Build a history of thinking, not just outcomes

## Usage

- Create a new log file per day or per session
- Use [this link](https://github.com/dmitriz/health-routines/new/main/log?filename=2024-04-30-log.md) to start a new log with today’s date
- Name files like `YYYY-MM-DD-log.md` for consistency
